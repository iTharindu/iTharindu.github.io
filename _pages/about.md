I am a Final Year PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) advised by [Dr Ian Pratt-Hartmann](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/ian.pratt/) and [Dr Riza Batista-navarro](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/riza.batista/). Previously, I have worked as a Data Scientist at [Turing](https://www.turing.com/), a Research Scientist at the [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) advised by [Prof Gihan Dias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7RdoTPkAAAAJ&hl=en) and a Machine Learning Intern at Zeptolytics. This Summer, I will be starting a new position as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

I graduated with my bachelor's degree from the [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) in 2021 specializing in Computer Science and Engineering. 

My research interests are Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning with a focus on the subdomains of Natural Language Understanding, Auto-regressive transformer models, and Reinforcement Learning.
